MinecartDelivery
=============

_Automated Chest Deposition/Recovery_

Purpose
------------

I was looking for a simple mod that could deposit a Chest Minecart's contents into a Chest block without any commands for setup or usage. Some other plugins had this functionality, but it also provided a bunch of other unvanilla-like functionality that I didn't like. When I found MinecartDelivery, I sadly discovered that the author hadn't updated in a long time, and it didn't seem that he would. I then updated his mod, and added additional functions to it, such as recovering a chest's contents into a minecart.

Features
------------

* Drop off points are created by simply putting a detector rail and a chest along your existing minecart system.
* Supports double chests
* Minecart item recovery from chests
* Furnace support

Installation and Usage
------------------------------

Just drop MinecartDeliveryReborn.jar into your plugins directory, and you're ready to go.

To create a drop off point, you will need a container (Chest, Furnace, etc) and a detector rail. The chest must be one block lower than the detector rail. Once a storage minecart passes thru the rail, it will unload the contents to the adjacent chests automatically.

Below is an example of a drop off point:

* Multi-world support

Support will be added soon!

This plugin is fairly new, and is being tested on our server. If you find any bugs, please file a ticket.

Download
--------

A built jar file is available for download [here](https://github.com/downloads/shinyquagsier23/MinecartDelivery/MinecartDeliveryReborn.jar).

I will be uploading the latest stable version here. I will also update the one in [bukkitdev](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/minecartdeliveryreborn/), but because they require approval, it'll probably take some time.
